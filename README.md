# What is Save n Search?
An app where users can search and save books from Google Books Collection and also add custom entries to the reading list. 

equires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

# How it works?
Save n Search is a MERN application built using NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, React, Google Books API and Bootstrap CSS Framework. 

Using React components, helper/util functions and lifecycle methods, books are retrieved from a book database and dynamically rendered based on user search results. 

Express sends user entries / selections to a database resulting in the reading list re-rendering reflecting the database's new addition.
