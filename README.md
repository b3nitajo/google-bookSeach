# Welcome to Save N Search
Create custom reading list on the go! 

# What is Save N Search?
Save N Search is a MERN web application designed for users who love to read. Search for your next book club idea or keep track of **"Up Next"** Novels all in one place. 

#### How is it used?
Users can search Google Book Collection using a keyword like **"Sports"**. Search results and custom book entries can be saved to a reading list. Book ideas can be removed and added to a list at any time.

# How it works?
Using React components, books are fetched from Google Books database and dynamically rendered with no need to refresh. 

When a user saves an entry to a reading list, Express sends the entry to a database while React re-renders the readlist with the new entry.
